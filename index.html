            <p>I am a hard worker who strives to be a perfectionist. I love the challenge that coding brings and that it forces me to learn new things as well as pushes me to constantly get better at being a developer.</p>

            <p>When I am not coding, I love being outdoors and hanging out with my girlfriend and puppy, Reptar. Not only do I love being outside but I also love playing video games and watching sports. All of my favorites teams are in Washington, DC.</p>

          <h3>Whittier WoodWorks Website</h3>
          <p>I built this website for my brother's woodworking business. I used a lot of flexbox to position divs where I wanted them. If you look at my CSS code, you can see alternative lines of heavy flexbox code that allows for a photo gallery instead of image carousel. The technologies I used were HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I utilized JavaScript to create an image carousel that allows users to click through the photo gallery.</p>
