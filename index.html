    <h2>About Greg</h2>
      <article> <!--Is this the proper use of an article container?-->
    <p>While attending Salisbury University, I thought politics was what I wanted to do but more than halfway through I realized coding was something that interested me far beyond what political science did. So, I started a codecademy account and began teaching myself. After college, I worked in property management where I eventually realized that is not what my calling was.</p>
    <p>When I became a student at <strong>Thinkful</strong> I realized software development is what I should have been doing all along. I love to challenge myself and be rewarded for that challenge.</p>
    <p>If you are looking to hire a software developer, look no further! I am eager to learn and grow in an easy-going, challenging environment. I would love to be apart of your next project!</p>
